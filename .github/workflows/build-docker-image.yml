# build docker image and push to docker hub

# note: this won't work because the cross-platform build takes around 10h,
# but github limits us to 6h.
# so need to build it locally and push to docker hub.
# see Dockerfile for instructions.

# needs github secrets set for -
#   DOCKERHUB_USERNAME - ie mtconnect
#   DOCKERHUB_TOKEN - token for that account

# Set VERSION below before building.
# See CMakeLists.txt for the current version.
# Note: this will tag the image with that version, as well as 'latest'.
